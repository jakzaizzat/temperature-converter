## Setting up the development environment ðŸ› 

1. Clone this repo or download the zip folder.
2. Run the `npm install` to install all the dependency.
3. Run `npm start` in the root folder to start the application


## Script to run
```
npm run start       -   To run the application in port 3000
npm run build       -   To build for production usage
npm run test   	  -   Run unit test cases
npm run cypress     -   Run e2e test using cypress
```


## Planning

Based on the instruction, there are two objectives that need to be done. The first one is the temperature converter and theme toggle.

First thing, I do a quick design in Figma on how the UI will look alike - [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/qnR3IWFeMAUlqrpikS7Yzl/Peatix?node-id=0%3A1). To reduce the amount of iteration during the development process.


## Development

### Tech Stack
* React for JS Framework
* TailwindCSS for CSS
* Jest for Unit testing
* Cypress for end-to-end testing

### Frontend Architecture
I decide to use **React** for the Frontend framework because it's easier for me to get started, and building a single page application would be a great choice for this kind of feature. Since Peatixâ€™s currently searching for someone with React experience, then itâ€™s a good idea for me to show my skill.

The idea will be building a single page application. The structure is going to be so simple.

I'll create one page/container component with multiples components that come together.

The UI will be split into component-based so that it will be easier to build and to test it.

#### CSS
I'm using **tailwindCSS** for the CSS framework. Its a utility library. It's easier for me to build the UI with it since you donâ€™t need to deal with custom CSS files. Furthermore, their color scheme looks good too.

#### Unit testing
**Jest** will be my go-to framework for the unit testing. Component without testing doesnâ€™t convince me that it's going to work. So, I wrote several test cases to ensure the component is robust enough before pushing it to production.

#### End-to-end testing
Unit testing is useful for testing the code/abstract level, but we need to find a way to test or simulate user behavior. Thatâ€™s where the end-to-end comes in. Iâ€™m using **Cypress** to automate all the user behavior.

1. The user will enter a celcius value and get the Fahrenheit.
2. The user will enter a Fahrenheit value and get the Celcius.
3. The user will toggle the theme button, and the color scheme will be changed.

#### Deployment
Iâ€™m using vercel to deploy the UI. It will automatically deploy whenever I pushed new changes in the GitHub.

## Features

### Temperature Converter

I'm going to add two input fields for Celcius and Fahrenheit. The idea is to let the user get an instant result after entering the value. We donâ€™t need the submit button.

This is the calculation for:

1. Celcius to Fahrenheit
`((farenheit - 32) * 5) / 9`

2. Fahrenheit to Celcius
`(celcius * 9) / 5 + 32`

### Theme Switcher

I've added a toggle button at the top right. To make it more standout, I use a different icon for each theme: sun icon for a light theme and moon icon for the dark theme.

The light theme comes with a more light dominant color, so the color scheme I choose needs to be well blended and easy for users to read. The same thing goes to the dark theme.

I'm using a color palette website - [Coolors - The super fast color schemes generator!](https://coolors.co/) to comes up with the color scheme, then Iâ€™m playing around with the hue to make sure its blend together.

To implement this, Iâ€™m going to use the CSS variable to make the color will be dynamic. Itâ€™s going to be like this.

```css
.theme-light {
    --bg-background-primary: #F5F9FC;
}
.theme-dark {
    --bg-background-primary: #141822;
}
```

We will detect whether the theme is dark or light by using a specific class `theme-light` or `theme-dark` in the body of the DOM.
